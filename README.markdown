This is going to be a large project so any help is appreciated. I ask that any submitted coded come with proper tests.

This project uses Amazon S3 for storing images. You can either use your own credentials (I believe Amazon has a free 5GB tier), or ask me for the test credentials I use. 

These credentials are stored in environment variables.
